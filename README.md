# Object_Detection

This project is focused towards creating an Object detection model by use of Transfer learning, to detect user-defined categories. A pretrained SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite 320x320 model, provided by [TensorFlow 2 Detection Model Zoo](<https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md>) has been retrained on a dataset comprising 4 characters belonging to anime Naruto. 
And the trained model was successful in detecting all 4 categories with an accuracy > 90% each.
